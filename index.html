<!--* I got bills I gotta pay
So I'ma gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'ma gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills

All these bills pile up my desk
They looking like a mount
All the little kids run around
I can hear their stomach growl
There's a full moon out
And my girl just keep on howlin'
Said she gonna leave me if I don't home with fifty thousand
Fifty thousand? Ah damn, ah damn, ah damn, ah damn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
Ah damn, oh man, ah damn, oh man

I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills

Woke up and I bumped my head
Stumped my toe on the edge of the bed
Opened the fridge and the food all gone
Neighbor's damn dog done crapped on my lawn
Hopped in the car and the car won't start
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk
Behind an old lady in the grocery line
Praying that my card won't get declined
Ah damn, ah damn, ah damn, ah damn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
Ah damn, oh man, ah damn, oh man

I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got

And my shoes, my shoes
I said my shoes
Ain't got no soul

I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills

Yo momma got bills, yo daddy got bills
Yo sister got bills, Yo auntie got bills (I got bills)
Yo uncle got bills
Everybody got bills, everybody got bills, uh -->
